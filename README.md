# healthcare_analytics_2

This repository contains the notebook for the Anaytics Vidhya hackathon Jantahack Healthcare Anlaytics 2. The competition was about the prediction of the Length Of Stay of a patient at a hospital. This was primarly done to help the hospital management better organise the schedule of the patient and provide them with much better benefits at the hospital.

The dataset consisted of a lot of categorical features here relating to the hospital region, ward condition, patient illness, etc. It was tough to extract information from the columns and increase the accuracy score by as small as 0.01. We have used here XGBoost for the training and classification of data.
